## ðŸ“¦ How It Works

1. **User fills out the registration form**:
   - Name
   - Father Name
   - Password

2. **Live validation** checks for:
   - At least one uppercase letter
   - At least one lowercase letter
   - At least one special character (e.g. `!@#$%`)
   - Minimum length (8+)

3. On clicking **Register**:
   - User data is passed to a new panel
   - Data display panel shows with entered info

4. Optionally, a **Timer** can show the current time
